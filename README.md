# Kc - A toy programming language

Kc is a toy **programming language** that is designed to be simple, easy to learn, and fun to use. It is a statically typed language, meaning every variable, function, and expression must have an explicitly declared type. No implicit type conversions are allowed.

Currently, Kc is a work-in-progress and only the lexer is implemented.
